### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I spent a bunch of today getting setup for 100 days of code and reviewing the AJAX section on freeCodeCamp.  Looking forward to diving into the local weather project tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I am really just getting started on coding and I am trying to focus on javascript for web development. I imagine this will ultimately turn into node.js etc but I am really trying to focus on learning javascript first to keep the scope narrow.  I just finished up the free part of PracticalJavascript (after originally doing some of freeCodeCamp).  I am now coming back to freeCodeCamp to see it through to the end.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress**: I spent time creating my freeCodeCamp weather app

**Thoughts**: Today's progress was good but slower than I liked.  I was able to complete a basic celsius to farenheit calculation and solved the longitude\latitude problem.  Tomomorrow I will need to build in additional logic to toggle in place celsius and farenheit.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress**: Completed the user stories for the weather app.  

**Thoughts**: So today I completed the stories for hte FCC weather app.  There is certainly room for improvement but at this time I wanted to complete the challenge and move on to the next task.  Maybe one day I will revisit to pretty it up a little bit.

### Day 4 -7 : January 5 - 8, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Wiki Viewer web page

**Thoughts**: Didn't have a ton of time over the weekend to work on the webpage.  WHad visitors from out of town and was out as well.  Need to focus back on this and get down to business again.  Struggling with the ajax queries for wiki API and turning it into something.
