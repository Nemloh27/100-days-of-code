### Day 1: January 2nd, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I spent a bunch of today getting setup for 100 days of code and reviewing the AJAX section on freeCodeCamp.  Looking forward to diving into the local weather project tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I am really just getting started on coding and I am trying to focus on javascript for web development. I imagine this will ultimately turn into node.js etc but I am really trying to focus on learning javascript first to keep the scope narrow.  I just finished up the free part of PracticalJavascript (after originally doing some of freeCodeCamp).  I am now coming back to freeCodeCamp to see it through to the end.
